# PrismX

A **reverse proxy server** written in [Go](https://go.dev/).  
This project is currently in its **early development phase** â€” the goal is to build a lightweight reverse proxy with features like consistent hashing, load balancing, and pluggable middlewares.

## âœ¨ Features (Work in Progress)
- âœ… Basic **consistent hashing** implementation  
- âœ… Server ring management (add/remove servers dynamically)  
- ðŸš§ Request routing  
- ðŸš§ Reverse proxy handler  
- ðŸš§ Virtual nodes for smoother load distribution  
- ðŸš§ Configurable middlewares (logging, rate-limiting, etc.)
